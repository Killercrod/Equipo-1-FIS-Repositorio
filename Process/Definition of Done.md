## **Definition of Done**
Since the application to assist FMAT students is in the wireframe phase, it is essential to plan the tests that will be implemented once development begins.

> **Unit Tests:**

**Objective**: To validate that each individual component of the application works correctly.

**Characteristics**: These tests focus on specific functions and methods within the code. They allow detecting errors at early stages, ensuring that each part of the system operates as expected before integrating with other modules. This is crucial to ensure that basic functionalities, such as loading materials and displaying information, are correct.


> **Integration Tests:**

**Purpose**: To evaluate how the different modules of the application interact.

**Characteristics**: These tests ensure that the system components work together cohesively. For example, it will check that the information provided by the teachers is correctly integrated with the user interface and that the data flows smoothly between the different modules of the application

> **Functional Tests**:

**Purpose**: Verify that the application meets the established functional requirements.

**Features**: Focus on functionalities from the user's perspective, ensuring that all features, such as loading subjects and displaying additional information, work as expected. This is vital so that students can access the information needed to make informed decisions about their academic load.

> **Penetration Testing**:

**Purpose**: To identify vulnerabilities in the application that could be exploited by attackers.

**Characteristics**: These tests simulate real attacks to evaluate the security of the system. Since the application will handle sensitive student and teacher information, it is crucial to ensure that the data is protected against unauthorized access. This will help build trust in the platform and protect user privacy.

> **Security Testing**:

**Purpose**: To ensure that the application is protected against threats and attacks.

**Characteristics**: Include the evaluation of authentication, authorization and data encryption. It is essential that only authorized users can access certain functionalities, especially those involving personal and academic information.

> **Performance Tests**:

**Purpose**: To evaluate how the application behaves under different load conditions.

**Characteristics**: These tests measure the speed, responsiveness and stability of the application under heavy usage conditions. For the FMAT application, it is essential that it can handle multiple users simultaneously, especially during periods of high demand, such as the registration of materials. 

OTHERS?
Troubleshooting Guide: Testing will help identify and resolve issues before the application is deployed, which is crucial to the success of the product.

User Stories: Testing should align with user stories to ensure that the needs and expectations of students and teachers are met.

System Architecture: Test planning should consider the system architecture to ensure that all components are integrated effectively.

Scenario Test Cases: Test cases should be developed that simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring that the application works correctly in various situations that users may face.
