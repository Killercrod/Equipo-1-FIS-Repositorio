## **PROCESS** 
## TASKS

Our team divided the work into different tasks in the projects section, where a new one was created focused for the first delivery. The tasks were divided into different categories with respect to the time, effort and resources used to complete them, these tasks; both completed and in progress, were categorized with three different colors.
In this section, we will show about our metrics.

|Green|Yellow|Red|
|--|--|--|
|Low-complexity tasks equivalent to 1 point.|Tasks that take 2 or 3 days because they require more resources and effort, equals 2 points.|These are the most time-consuming, highest priority tasks and are equivalent to 3 points.|

In this deliverable, as you can see in the metrics marked under the three colors: green, yellow and red, respectively divided into To Do, Doing and Done, where members move the task categories with respect to what they are doing, likewise the tasks have a category with respect to the deliverable, for example, if you want to filter the Requirements tasks, you can easily do it with those tags.

## **Branches**

In this delivery, specifically in teamwork, a branch was created for each member, according to the metric a color is named for each member, who will receive a score according to their participation in the whole first phase.

The final score of each of our members for phase 1 is:

- César Augusto Rodriguez Te (RED): 25 pts
