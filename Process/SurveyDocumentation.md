# SURVEY DOCUMENTATION

## Introduction

For the usability tests, three scenarios were presented where the interface features were evaluated by different testers, all of whom were students. They tested the functionalities of the interface and navigated through it. The goal was to see how well the application supports students in selecting the right courses for future semesters.

## Scenario 1

*"You finished your first semester and passed all your subjects, so you'd like to see which courses you should load based on the courses you've already completed."*

- **Description**: In this scenario, students are asked to check which courses they could take in the next semester, based on the courses they've already completed.

- **Results**:
  - **Positive feedback**: All testers agreed that the information is presented in a way that is easy to read and not overwhelming. The information regarding related courses is clear and precise.

## Scenario 2

*"You finished your first semester but didn't pass the math or computing-related courses."*

- **Description**: Considering the courses from the second semester for the next course load, the testers decided to retake *Analytical Geometry* as a repeated course.

- **Results**:
  - The testers also decided to postpone other mathematics-related courses, such as *Differential Calculus*, *Advanced Algebra*, and *Discrete Mathematics*, for future semesters.
  - They agreed that understanding the scope and prerequisites of each course is very helpful for deciding which subjects to take next.

## General Observations

- The goal of creating an intuitive guide for the first three semesters was achieved. The color-coding system made it easier to understand the course load.
- However, it was noted that the information about being unprepared for a course could be made clearer.
- Users suggested adding additional features to make the program more versatile, such as implementing a user system where students could share opinions about courses. This would make the user experience more personalized and intuitive.
