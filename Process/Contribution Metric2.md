## **Process**
## Tasks

Our team divided the work into different tasks in the projects section, where a new one was created focused on the second delivery. The tasks were divided into different categories with respect to the time, effort and resources used to complete them, these tasks; both completed and in progress, were categorized with three different colors.

|Green|Yellow|Red|
|--|--|--|
|Low-complexity tasks equivalent to 1 point.|Tasks that take 2 or 3 days because they require more resources and effort, equals 2 points.|These are the most time-consuming, highest priority tasks and are equivalent to 3 points.|

The tasks were divided into To Do, Doing and Done, where the members move the task categories with respect to what they are doing, likewise the tasks have a category with respect to the deliverable, for example, if you want to filter the Requirements tasks, you can easily do it with those tags.

Members assign themselves to such tasks to keep evidence of who worked on them in the Assignees section, looking for our users and assigning us on our own.

Each member adds a comment specifying what he/she did in the task:

Once the task is ready, it is moved to the Done.

## **Branches**
Each member made a personal branch where they upload progress and documentation of their contributions to the main branch of the second delivery, whether drafts or things that were modified, all this to have evidence of the contributions of the team members.
