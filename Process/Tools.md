# Tools

During the first delivery, in terms of time, we divide it into two types, virtual and face-to-face.

Presential - We work on Tuesdays starting at 11:00 am and ending at 13:00 pm and on Fridays we start at 9:30 am and ending at 11:00 am; in this time we will work on activities required by the whole team, and to answer questions about the project and make everything clear, for corrections as well, all this will make the virtual and presential time have the same productivity time.

In the virtual time we perform individual tasks or in small teams, all this through Github, WhatsApps, Teams we work from information gathering to resolution of simple tasks, so it does not have much difficulty, ie can be completed in 1 or 2 hours, all this work will be recorded in a project planner and in this repository with the intention of having a better and more assertive organization for the resolution of the project.
Our team used different tools in order to manage the repository, we used WhatsApp as a way to communicate and see how we were doing with our tasks.

The planner template on GitHub was very useful too, there, each task was created and assigned the respective color based on the difficulty of it and the time it required, each member had to assign themselves in the tasks and leave a comment saying what they did in order to have a track of the evidence, sorting the tasks in To Do, Doing and Done, depending on the current status.
