# Tools
Our team used different tools in order to manage the repository, we used WhatsApp as a way to communicate and see how we were doing with our tasks.

The planner template on GitHub was very useful too, there, each task was created and assigned the respective color based on the difficulty of it and the time it required, each member had to assign themselves in the tasks and leave a comment saying what they did in order to have a track of the evidence, sorting the tasks in To Do, Doing and Done, depending on the current status.
