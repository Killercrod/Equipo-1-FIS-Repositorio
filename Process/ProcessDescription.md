## **Process**
## Tasks

Our team divided the work into different tasks in the projects section, where a new one was created focused on the second delivery. The tasks were divided into different categories with respect to the time, effort and resources used to complete them, these tasks; both completed and in progress, were categorized with three different colors.

|Green|Yellow|Red|
|--|--|--|
|Low-complexity tasks equivalent to 1 point.|Tasks that take 2 or 3 days because they require more resources and effort, equals 2 points.|These are the most time-consuming, highest priority tasks and are equivalent to 3 points.|

The tasks were divided into To Do, Doing and Done, where the members move the task categories with respect to what they are doing, likewise the tasks have a category with respect to the deliverable, for example, if you want to filter the Requirements tasks, you can easily do it with those tags.

Members assign themselves to such tasks to keep evidence of who worked on them in the Assignees section, looking for our users and assigning us on our own.

Once the task is ready, it is moved to the Done.

## **Branches**
Each member made a personal branch where they upload progress and documentation of their contributions to the main branch of the second delivery, whether drafts or things that were modified, all this to have evidence of the contributions of the team members.

## **Chronogram**

Face-to-face: we worked on Tuesdays from 11 to 1 PM and Fridays from 9:30 to 11 AM; during these periods of time we worked on joint or individual activities, we also discussed the progress of the project and solved doubts of the members. In this phase 2, face-to-face work had more weight than virtual work, since we met and carried out activities more frequently during the aforementioned time periods.

Virtual: in the virtual work, small tasks were carried out, mostly individually, to correct the repository or add missing information; these tasks were carried out at non-specific times and arose when it was necessary to refine some detail of the repository; they were discussed via chat and carried out. The virtual work, having less weight than the face-to-face work, was recorded as comments in the project planner with the intention of recording the small details in the repository.
