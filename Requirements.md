## **Evolution of the Requirements**

During the course of the third delivery, the development of the wireframe and the validation of the use cases from future clients (students of the FMAT) were key for the delivery. Through this process, the main needs of the users were clarified and reinforced, leading to modifications in both functional and non-functional requirements from the previous versions.

As a result, compared to the second delivery’s requirements, the third delivery’s requirements changed because the MoSCoW method was implemented, refining and preserving the previous requirements based on insights gathered from the use cases.

In conclusion, the changes in the requirements were aligned with the modifications made to the wireframe, resulting in 3 functional requirements and 4 non-functional requirements, as compared to the second delivery which had 6 functional and 3 non-functional requirements.
