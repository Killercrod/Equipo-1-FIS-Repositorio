## **Product evolution**

> ### **Birth of the project and first visions** 
>*To begin to investigate the evolution of the project, ranging from methodologies, ideas, structure and documentation, we must see how the idea of the project was born.*

As a first instance when brainstorming about what we should base our project on, we were all inclined to talk about a common topic and difficulty which was the system of loading subjects, knowing with which professors we should load the subjects and what we needed to know so as not to fail or to carry out the path as enjoyable as possible throughout our stay at the university,   Being first-year students and having 0 knowledge about these issues, we decided that we could do something about it and base our project on that, precisely to solve the problem that many first-year students have.

In the first instance, the project was a guide in which students through the UADYES/UADYVIRTUAL platform, mainly those from the first to third semester, could have a section in which they could review the list of compulsory subjects and with which teachers they are offered, as well as a list of all teachers along with a business card in which students could see the pass rates that the students have with each teacher, general presentation of each one and work methodology.
On the subject side, they would have a general description of each one, in which I would tell them the previous knowledge that was needed to load these subjects.

However, throughout the evolution and approach as well as the beginning of the documentation, we realized that there would be certain issues that could limit the main idea of the project, such as the fact that teachers do not always teach the same subjects every semester, in addition to the fact that there is no access to the platform in charge of uploading subjects (SICEI) much less to their information,   Therefore, the idea changed to instead of focusing on the information provided by the teachers, focusing more on the subjects that would be recommended to load and which not to load based on the student's previous knowledge, through a series of generic and specific competencies to be fulfilled, thus moving with the following objective:
> ### **Our objective is to be able to facilitate the process by which new students experience the load of subjects at the end of the ones they have at that time, it is proposed to do it in an interactive way, as well as using information such as the generic and specific competencies of each individual subject to obtain greater clarity of each one,  this in order to have more understanding about the subjects to be loaded in a future semester and not have problems understanding the subjects that the student is charging.**
