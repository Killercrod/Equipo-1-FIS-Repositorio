## **Evolution of the Product**

> ### **First ideas for the project** 
>*In order to see the evolution of our project, including metodologies, ideas, structures and documentation, we must see how the project was originally conceived*

First of all, we did a brainstorm of various ideas on how our project should be used for, we all agreed about the complications of charging schoolar subjects, know with which teachers you should charge and what do you need in order to approve the assignment making this a comfortable and easy experience for new students, we all agreed that the main focus should be to make the proccess of charging subjects something more easiers and with a more complete information.

Our project first was a guide where students, using the virtual platforms UADYES/UADYVIRTUAL, can gain access to a new section where they could see the subjects and which teachers impart it, the students could also see a presentation card of each professor where they could a general description about them, how they impart their classes and the approvement rate. All of this was mainly focused on students from first to third semester.

However, through the evolution and documentation, we realized that there were certain cases that would limit how our project would be developed, for example, not all teachers impart the same subjects all the semesters, there is also no access to the platform where you can charge the subjects (SICEI) and neither to the information, that's why the idea changed to give information that the teachers gave us, focusing more on which subjects you should charge and which not depending on your current skills, using the generic and specific skills that all subjects have, changing our objective to:
> ### **Our objective is to facilitate the process that new students go through when managing their course load, especially as they complete the courses they are currently taking. The plan is to achieve this in an interactive way, using information such as the generic and specific skills of each subject to provide greater clarity about each one. This is aimed at helping students to better understand the courses they will need to take in future semesters, ensuring they encounter fewer difficulties with the courses they are currently enrolled in.**
