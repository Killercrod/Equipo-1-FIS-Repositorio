### **Non-Functional Requirements Related to Usability**

- **Clear Visual Feedback from the System**  
  **Functionality**: The system uses emojis to provide feedback on the student's aptitude regarding the selected competencies. Each emoji must clearly represent the student's level of aptitude for subjects in future semesters.  
  **Metrics**: A verbal test to evaluate the understanding of the emojis and icons to ensure the wireframe's functionality is clear.  
  **Comprehension Time**: Users must understand the meaning of the icons immediately after they are displayed.  
  **Usability Testing**: Conduct usability tests in which at least 7 out of 10 participants rate the clarity of the visual feedback as "good" or higher on a scale of 1 to 5.  

- **Ease use for the Traffic Light System for Course Selection**  
  **Functionality**: The traffic light system is designed to provide recommendations to students, helping them determine which subject is best to take next.  
  **Metrics**: A simulation test where the application context is explained to the user, and they are asked to demonstrate how it works.  
  **Number of Clicks**: The number of clicks should be within the average range based on feedback from users and testers.  

- **Ease of System Navigation**  
  **Requirement**: The system structure must be easy to follow and understand, allowing students to navigate between semesters and competencies with minimal steps.  
  **Metric**: In usability tests, at least 7 out of 10 participants should be able to navigate between semesters and competencies in the wireframe without assistance.
