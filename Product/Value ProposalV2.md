### VALUE PROPOSITION  

The value proposition refers to the unique value that a software product or service offers to its users or customersâ€”in other words, the perceived value the software provides as a solution to a specific problem or need. This value may include features such as quality, technical support, and the ability to address challenges the "product" may face in the market.  

In the **FTBUADY project**, our academic management system offers a comprehensive and efficient solution for students, facilitating enrollment, access to academic information, and interaction with professors within a secure and user-friendly environment. The benefits provided by FTBUADY include:  

- *Detailed Subject Information:*  
  The guide breaks down subjects into three main features: tips, competencies, and a description of the subject.  

- *Subjects Broken Down by Specific Competencies:*  
  The guide outlines each subject by specific competencies, allowing users to select those they consider applicable to their skills.  

- *Subject-Specific Advice System:*
  The guide provides users with recommendations when selecting generic competencies for a subject, offering advice if they should avoid enrolling in a subject they do not meet the requirements for. Conversely, it provides positive guidance when a subject is suitable for them.
