# Evolution of Our Requirements

#### At the beginning of our project, our focus was not entirely clear, as we were unsure which functionalities were truly necessary for the application to fulfill its purpose. This led us to include a large number of requirements, many of which were unnecessary or irrelevant, making the system overly complex. In this early stage, our intention was to cover all types of information and functionalities, with the idea of creating a comprehensive tool. However, as development progressed and we received feedback from interviews with students and professors, we realized that this broad approach was not aligned with the actual needs of the end users.

#### It was then that we identified what students were truly looking for: clarity and simplicity. They wanted easy access to basic information about courses, such as generic and specific competencies, and tools that would allow them to effectively plan the subjects they should take based on their preparation. Additionally, we noticed that more advanced features, such as highly detailed data analysis or complex projections, were unnecessary and even intimidating for users.

#### From this insight, we began a process of refinement. We started eliminating requirements that did not provide direct value to the user and prioritizing those that truly addressed their needs, such as clear visualization of competencies, a color-coded system to indicate the probability of success, and personalized recommendations for tackling challenging courses. This more focused approach not only simplified the system but also ensured that it was aligned with the actual expectations and needs of the students.

#### This evolutionary process not only improved the functionality of the system but also taught us the importance of designing with the end user in mind. Thanks to this iterative approach, we were able to create an efficient and accessible tool that focuses on the essentials and provides students with the confidence and clarity they need to make informed decisions about their academic workload.
