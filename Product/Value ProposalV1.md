## VALUE PROPOSAL

It refers to the unique value that a software product or service offers to its users or customersâ€”in other words, the perceived value that the software provides as a solution to a specific problem or need of the consumer. This value can include features such as quality, technical support, and the ability to address the challenges the "product" may face in the market.
In the FTBUADY project, our academic management system provides a comprehensive and efficient solution for students, making easier the registration, access to academic information, and interaction with the teachers branch within a secure and user-friendly environment.
The benefits that FTBUADY will provide include:
- Easier registration and access through user registration and secure login.
- access to academic information via the academic curriculum map and course offerings.
- interaction with teachers with access to faculty information, allowing students to view, consult, and contact their instructors.
