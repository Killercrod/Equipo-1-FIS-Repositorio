                                                                  Value Proposition
Our educational platform stands out for its focus on clarity and precision in software requirements, 
ensuring that students have access to relevant and up-to-date information about their subjects. 
Through a rigorous requirements engineering process, we have identified and defined key features that make our system the ideal choice for UADY students.

                                                 Access to Complete and Updated Information
The platform provides detailed information about the subjects, including descriptions, requirements, and profiles of the instructors. 
This allows students to make informed decisions about their academic workload and facilitates a more enriching learning experience.

                                             Intuitive Interface for an Optimal User Experience
With a user-centered design, our interface is easy to navigate, improving accessibility and user satisfaction. 
Students can quickly find the information they need, contributing to a more effective and enjoyable learning environment.

                                                         Security and Exclusivity in Access
The platform uses UADY virtual credentials to ensure that only authorized students can access the content.
This not only protects sensitive information but also ensures that the content is relevant and specific to the university community, promoting responsible educational use.
The project not only meets functional and non-functional requirements but also aligns with the needs and expectations of students, providing security in their course load and academic future.
