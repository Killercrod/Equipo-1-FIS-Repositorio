# Interviewee (Lic. Alejandro Waldemar Cobá Magaña) 
What do you think are the main reasons why students struggle to understand the content of the subjects during their first semester?
Deficiency in prior knowledge to develop the necessary skills for the course.

How does personal motivation influence students' academic performance, and do you think it contributes to academic failure during their first year?
A lot, without motivation nothing can be done; perseverance and the ability to do everything from the beginning.

Do you consider that the relationship between students and teachers is critical for good performance?
It is fundamental; whether it's critical or not is debatable. It has become a bit impersonal due to the growth and magnitude of students.
Additionally, the administrative burden has increased.

What strategies or resources do you think could help students improve their performance and avoid failure in their subjects?
Both things; the strategy needs resources. According to MEFI, there should not be groups of more than 35, and even then, it is not being met. 
Reduce group sizes, hire more teachers, and have adequate facilities.
