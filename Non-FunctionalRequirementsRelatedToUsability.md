# Non-Functional Requirements Related to Usability

- **Clear Visual Feedback from the System**  
  **Functionality**: The system uses emoticons to provide feedback on the student's proficiency in relation to the selected competencies. Each emoticon should clearly represent the student's proficiency level for subjects in subsequent semesters.

  **Metrics**: A spoken test to assess understanding of the emoticons and icons, ensuring users comprehend the wireframe’s functionality.

  **Comprehension Time**: The user should understand the meaning of the icons immediately after they are shown.

  **Usability Testing**: Conduct usability tests where at least 7 out of 10 participants rate the clarity of the visual feedback as "good" or higher on a scale of 1 to 5.

- **Ease of Use for the "Traffic Light" System for Course Possibility**  
  **Functionality**: The traffic light system provides advice to the student, helping them determine which course is best to take next.

  **Metrics**: A simulation test in which the user is given context about the application and then demonstrates the expected outcome.

  **Number of Clicks**: The number of clicks should fall within the average range based on users' and testers' behavior.

- **Ease of Navigation in the System**  
  The system’s structure should be easy to follow and understand, clearly showing how students will navigate between semesters and competencies with minimal steps.

  **Metric**: In usability tests, at least 7 out of 10 participants should be able to navigate between semesters and competencies in the wireframe without assistance.
