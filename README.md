###INTRODUCTION<a name="id1"></a>
Hello in this file we will talk about how we work in these weeks and explain step by step how we're going to use the tools, how we administrate them, how we will assign to each teammate the degree of participation in which they were involved, how much time it takes each activity, the priority of each one of the tasks and the done ones.

**WORK SYSTEM**<a name="id2"></a>
The work has been divided by tasks, each one of these is subdivided depending on how much time, effort, and reources it takes to achieve them.
They're subdivided in 3 colors:

 ![Metodologia](https://github.com/Killercrod/Equipo-1-FIS-Repositorio/blob/main/Assets/Metodologia.png)
    
*Green color* - With this color we identify the tasks that can be finished in approximately 2 or 3 days, they need 1 or 2 teammates because of the low complexity of them, these are assigned at the beginning of the each fase because they are fundamentals for preparing the biggest tasks 
*Yellow color* - With this color we identify the tasks that can be finished in approximately 2 or 3 days, with the difference that they need 3 or 4 teammates to be finished, they are conformed of some of the green color tasks 
*Red color* - With this color we identify the tasks that can be finished in at least a week, these tasks contain multiples green and yellow tasks, they're the most important tasks of the project, so they need more priority, that's why they're realized by the entire team  

**TASKS ASSIGNMENT**<a name="id3"></a>
In this work the parts of the projects will be assigned like "Fases", and these fases will be subdivided in parts, we will rely on the color categorization of the tasks.

FASE 1
**WORK TEAMS**<a name="id4"></a>
The work will be divided by work teams, and each team will be conformed by one teammate that will have their own branch, to edit the main part of the work on the repository:

 - BR - 1 - Cesar 
 - BR - 2 - David
 - BR - 3 - Omar 
 - BR - 4 - Ivan 
 - BR - 5 - Jorge 
 - BR - 6 - Braulio 
 - BR - 7 - Jonathan
 
 **Schedule**<a name="id5"></a>
In terms of time, we divide it in two tipes, the virtual and the presential
 - The presential - We work on Tuesday starting at 11:00 am and finishing at 13:00 pm and Tuesday, starting at 9:30 am and finishing at 11:00 am; in these times we will work on activities that requires the whole team, and for answer questions about the project and make it all clear, for corrections too, all of this for made the virtual time and the presential time, more successful and for make them have the same productivity time.
 - On the virtual time we make individual tasks or in a small teams, we work in information collection to resolution of simple tasks, for the same reason that it does not have much difficulty, so they can be finished in 1 or 2 hours, all of this work will be registered on a planner project and in this repository with the intention of having a better organization, and more assertive for the resolution of the project
