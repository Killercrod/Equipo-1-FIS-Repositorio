The final score of each of our members for phase 1 is:

César Augusto Rodriguez Te: 25 pts

Omar Sebastián Chim Canché: 25 pts 

Braulio Tello Mancilla: 25 pts 

Iván alejandro chi polanco: 25 pts 

David Jesús Novelo Ontiveros: 25 pts 

Jonathan Manuel Espinosa Castañeda: 25 pts 

Jorge Arturo Rangel Soberanis: 25 pts 

All phases will be evaluated with a total of 50 points, so if the team member has 25 points, it means they have completed all activities of the phase 1 correctly.
